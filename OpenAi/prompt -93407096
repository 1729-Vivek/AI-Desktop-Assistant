Dear [Name],

I am writing to request a leave of absence in order to attend to a personal matter. The leave is estimated to last for 3 days, starting from [date].

If there are any additional documents or information that you require, please do not hesitate to let me know. I remain available to answer any questions or concerns you might have.

As my work for the past few months has been going according to plan, I am sure that I can manage any unfinished tasks during my absence. I look forward to getting back and working with the team again.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
