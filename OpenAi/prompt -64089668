OpenAi response for prompt: using artificial intelligence write and letter to an hod for absence 
 ***************************



Dear [Name of Head of Department],

I am writing this letter to explain my recent absence from my work duties due to illness.

I’m very sorry I was unable to fulfil my obligations as a member of your team. I was recently diagnosed with a virus and unfortunately, was too sick to complete the tasks I was assigned.

In addition, I was advised by my doctor to avoid contact with other employees during this time, which is why I didn’t alert you and the team to my condition.

I understand the impact this could have had and assure you I have done everything I can to make up for the lost productivity. I will be better prepared in the future to expect and navigate through similar situations.

I hope you understand my absence and I am eager to make up for lost time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
